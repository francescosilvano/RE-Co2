## Introduction
The world is facing pressing environmental challenges, including climate change caused by the emission of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2). To mitigate the impact of climate change, there is a growing interest in renewable energy sources as a sustainable alternative to fossil fuels. This project aims to analyze the relationship between renewable energy production and CO2 emissions, providing insights into the environmental footprint of different energy sources.

## Data Collection
To conduct this analysis, a comprehensive dataset was collected, encompassing information on renewable energy production and CO2 emissions over a specified time period. The dataset includes data from various sources, such as government agencies, international organizations, and research publications. The data covers a range of countries and regions, allowing for a global perspective on the topic.

## Data Preprocessing
Before performing the statistical analysis, the collected data underwent preprocessing steps to ensure its quality and consistency. This included handling missing values, removing outliers, and standardizing the data format. Additionally, any necessary data transformations, such as aggregating yearly data or converting units, were performed to facilitate the analysis.

## Statistical Analysis
The statistical analysis consists of several key steps:

1. Descriptive Statistics: Compute summary statistics, such as mean, median, and standard deviation, to gain a general understanding of the dataset.


# Summary statistics for renewable energy production
summary(filtered_energy$`Electricity from renewables (TWh)`)
Correlation Analysis: Calculate the correlation coefficient between renewable energy production and CO2 emissions. This will help identify the strength and direction of the relationship between these variables.

Results
The results of the statistical analysis will be presented and interpreted in a clear and concise manner. Visualizations, such as charts, graphs, and tables, will be utilized to enhance the understanding of the findings. The results will address the research questions and hypotheses formulated in the project, shedding light on the relationship between renewable energy production and CO2 emissions.

Conclusion
In conclusion, this project aims to contribute to the understanding of the environmental footprint of renewable energy sources by conducting a statistical analysis of their correlation with CO2 emissions. By analyzing the collected data and presenting the results, we can gain valuable insights into the potential of renewable energy in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and fostering a sustainable future. The findings of this project can be used to inform policy decisions, energy planning, and further research in the field of renewable energy and environmental sustainability.
