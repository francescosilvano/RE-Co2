## Background

The global energy market heavily relies on crude oil as a primary source of energy. The price of crude oil plays a significant role in shaping the world economy, impacting various sectors such as transportation, manufacturing, and agriculture. Additionally, the combustion of fossil fuels, including oil, is a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change. Understanding the relationship between oil prices and environmental impact is crucial for devising sustainable energy strategies.

## Data

To conduct this analysis, we utilized historical data on WTI crude oil prices and corresponding CO2 emissions. The dataset includes daily or monthly records, covering a significant period, allowing for a comprehensive examination of the relationship between WTI prices and environmental footprint. 

## Methodology

The analysis involved several key steps:

1. Data Collection: Historical WTI price data and CO2 emissions data were collected from (DATA SOURCE)

2. Data Preprocessing: The collected data was cleaned and processed to remove any inconsistencies or missing values. Additionally, data normalization techniques were applied to ensure comparability.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis: The dataset was analyzed to gain insights into the trends, patterns, and distributions of WTI prices and CO2 emissions. This involved visualizations, statistical summaries, and correlation analyses.

4. Statistical Analysis: Various statistical methods, such as regression analysis, time series analysis, and hypothesis testing, were employed to quantify the relationship between WTI prices and CO2 emissions. The goal was to determine the extent to which oil price dynamics affect the environmental footprint.

## Results

The analysis of the WTI price dynamics and environmental footprint revealed the following key findings:

- Strong correlation: The statistical analysis indicated a significant correlation between WTI prices and CO2 emissions, suggesting that fluctuations in oil prices have a substantial impact on carbon dioxide emissions.

- Lagged effects: The relationship between oil prices and CO2 emissions exhibited some lagged effects, meaning that changes in oil prices could be observed to affect CO2 emissions with a certain time delay.

- Policy implications: The findings have implications for policymakers, energy companies, and environmental organizations, highlighting the need for sustainable energy strategies that consider the environmental consequences of oil price dynamics.

## Conclusions

The statistical analysis conducted in this project demonstrates a clear link between WTI prices and CO2 emissions. Understanding this relationship is crucial for assessing the environmental impact of oil price fluctuations and developing effective strategies to mitigate carbon emissions. The results emphasize the importance of sustainable energy alternatives and policies aimed at reducing reliance on fossil fuels.
